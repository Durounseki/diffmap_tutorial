    "We consider the evolution of a collection of interacting particles, $A=\\{a_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$, as a dynamical system. Each experimental observation of $A$, yields a state vector $X(t)=\\left(x_1(t), x_2(t),\\ldots, x_n(t) \\right)$, where the features $x_i(t)$ represent measurements specific to the system under study. These measurements might encompass, for instance, the position and the velocity, $x_i = (\\mathbf{x}_i,\\mathbf{v}_i)$, of the $i$-th bird in a flock of starlings or the activity of the $i$-th neuron in a neural network. Subsequent observations of $A$ generate a discrete time series \\mbox{$\\mathcal{X}=\\left\\{X_i\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}=\\left\\{X(t_i)\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$}, that represents a sampling of a trajectory in the associated phase space $\\mathcal{S}$ [see Fig.~\\ref{fig:method1}(a)]."

    "Dynamical systems interpretation of the collective behavior of a system of interacting particles $$A$$. (a) An experimental observation of $A$ at a given time $t$ is represented by the feature vector $X(t)$. Here, we use schooling juvenile zebra fish (\\textit{D. rerio}) as an illustration. In this case, the feature vectors consist of the positions and velocities of each individual in $A$, that is $x_i=(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{v}_i)$. (b) In the presence of a collective state, the state space $\\mathcal{S}$ contains structures such as $K_+$ and $K_-$ which correspond to swirling states with positive and negative angular momentum in the case of the schooling fish. The density of states is highly concentrated around the attractors $X_\\pm$. This allows us to use clustering techniques to identify the collective states $K_\\pm$ with positive and negative angular momentum. The background color gradient represents the density of states in $\\mathcal{S}$, it is higher around the attractors $X_{\\pm}$ and negligible around the isotropic configurations with random orientations, for example $X_0$ and $\\tilde{X}_0$.\n",
